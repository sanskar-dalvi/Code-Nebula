You are an expert C# code analyzer. Analyze the following C# code structure and return ONLY valid JSON.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Respond with ONLY the JSON object
2. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text
3. If no code is provided, still return the JSON structure with generic values
4. Always return valid JSON format
5. ALWAYS complete the JSON object with a closing brace }
6. Do not truncate your response - complete the entire JSON

Required JSON format:
{
  "summary": "brief description of the overall code structure",
  "tags": ["role", "pattern", "domain"],
  "dependencies": ["related classes", "interfaces", "types"]
}

Example valid responses:
{"summary":"AST parser implementation with visitor pattern","tags":["parser","ast","visitor-pattern","compilation"],"dependencies":["IAstVisitor","AstNode","CompilerContext"]}
{"summary":"Generic code structure","tags":["code","implementation"],"dependencies":[]}

Code to analyze:
{{AST_JSON}}

JSON Response (must be complete and valid):
