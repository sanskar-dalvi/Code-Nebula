# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* **Helping newcomers** understand the project and codebase
* **Sharing knowledge** about C# parsing, graph databases, and LLM integration
* **Contributing documentation** and examples to help others
* **Providing constructive code reviews** that help improve code quality

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* **Code sabotage** or intentionally introducing bugs or vulnerabilities
* **Sharing sensitive data** from parsed codebases without permission
* **Misusing LLM capabilities** for harmful or unethical purposes
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Given the nature of this project (C# code analysis and graph generation), we have
additional community guidelines:

### Data Privacy and Security

* **Never share** proprietary or sensitive code samples in public discussions
* **Use mock data** or anonymized examples when reporting issues
* **Respect confidentiality** of codebases being analyzed
* **Follow security best practices** when contributing code

### Technical Contributions

* **Test thoroughly** before submitting pull requests
* **Document changes** clearly, especially those affecting core parsing logic
* **Follow coding standards** outlined in the project documentation
* **Consider performance impact** of changes on large codebases
* **Validate Neo4j queries** and ensure they don't cause performance issues

### LLM and AI Ethics

* **Use local LLMs responsibly** and consider resource consumption
* **Avoid bias** in prompt engineering and model selection
* **Be transparent** about AI-generated content in contributions
* **Respect intellectual property** when training or using models

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* **GitHub repository** interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* **Documentation** and wiki contributions
* **Community forums** and chat channels
* **Conference presentations** or talks about the project
* **Social media** posts when representing the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Primary Contact**: Create a GitHub issue with the label "code-of-conduct"
**Email**: Use the contact information in the project README
**Security Issues**: Follow the procedures in SECURITY.md

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal by:

1. **Creating a GitHub issue** with the label "code-of-conduct-appeal"
2. **Providing detailed information** about the incident and why you believe the
   enforcement action was inappropriate
3. **Including relevant evidence** or context that supports your appeal

Appeals will be reviewed by a different set of community leaders than those who
made the original enforcement decision.

## Special Considerations for Technical Project

### Code Review Standards

* **Be constructive** in code reviews - focus on the code, not the person
* **Explain reasoning** behind requested changes
* **Acknowledge good work** and innovative solutions
* **Be patient** with contributors learning the codebase
* **Provide context** for complex architectural decisions

### Issue Reporting

* **Use appropriate labels** and templates when reporting issues
* **Provide minimal reproducible examples** when possible
* **Be responsive** to requests for additional information
* **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
* **Follow up** on your reported issues and test proposed fixes

### Documentation Contributions

* **Write for your audience** - consider the experience level of readers
* **Keep examples current** with the latest codebase changes
* **Test documentation** examples to ensure they work
* **Use inclusive language** in all documentation
